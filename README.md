Project: Recipes

The goal of this project is to create a basic recipe website.

To accomplish this, I will be employing the HTML skills I have learned thus far in The Odin Project.

At a later date, this project will be revisited to be improved with CSS.

2023-05-01: Added 3 recipes: Poutine, Pizza, and Spaghetti and Meatballs.
