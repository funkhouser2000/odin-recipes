    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Poutine is a <em>delicious</em> Canadian staple.</p>
    <p>At it's core, it's a very simple dish consisting of just 3 ingredients: French fries, cheese curds, and gravy.</p>
    <p>Some popular variations include adding chicken, beef, or pulled pork.</p>
    <p>This recipe will show you how to make a traditional poutine. If you've never had it before, I recommend trying it as is before customizing it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart of vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 (10.25 oz) can of beef gravy</li>
        <li>5 medium potatoes, cut into fries</li>
        <li>2 cups of cheese curds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, begin to warm the gravy.</li>
        <li><p>Place fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown (8 to 10 minutes).</p>
            <p>Cook fries in batches if necessary to give them enough room to move a little in the oil.</p>
            <p>Remove the fries from the deep fryer and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</p></li>
        <li>Place fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese curds over them.</li>
        <li>Ladle warmed gravy over the fries and cheese. Serve immediately.</li>    
    </ol>

    <h3>Variations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add cut-up cooked chicken or beef.</li>
        <li>Use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheese curds.</li>
        <li>Italian Poutine: Substitute marinara for gravy.</li>
        <li>BBQ Poutine: Substitute a light BBQ sauce for gravy.</li>
    </ul>
